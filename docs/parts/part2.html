	  <p>
			In this exercise you will extend your application to make the base <code class="prettyprint">Operation</code> class have a virtual method which is then overridden by each of the derived classes. You will then make the base class <em>abstract</em> so it cannot be used on it's own.
    </p>

    <h2>Required Assets</h2>
    <p>
      You can either continue from the previous exercise, or use the <b>Completed</b> solution from <b>Exercise 1</b> as a starting point for this exercise.
    </p>

		<!-- - - - - - - - - Steps - - - - - - - - -->

		<h1>Steps</h1>

    <h2>Add a virtual method to the Operation class</h2>
    <p>
      For our first step, let's add the <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code> method as a virtual method to the base <code class="prettyprint">Operation</code> class that all our math operations are deriving from.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the <b>Operation.cs</b> file you created in the previous exercise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a new method named <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code> that takes no parameters and returns a string.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since the method must return a string, just return an empty <code class="prettyprint">&quot;&quot;</code> string for now.
      </li>

      <p class="indent-none">
        Try to compile the application - you should get a warning from the compiler indicating that our derived classes are <em>hiding</em> the new method that's in our base class.
      </p>

      <img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/lab2-warning.PNG" width="800"/>

      <p class="indent-none">
         By default, methods are <em>not</em> virtual - therefore the <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code> method declared on the <code class="prettyprint">AddOperation</code> class is different than the one declared on the base class - even though they have the same parameters and return type. This is a very common bug in programs because depending on how you call this method, you will get different results! The proper way to fix this is to mark the base method as <code class="prettyprint">virtual</code> and then override it in each of our derived classes.
      </p>

      <div class="hintblock">
        Keen observers might notice that the compiler recommends to add the "new" keyword. This will silence the compiler warning, but will <em>not</em> change the behavior. 99.99% of the time this is the <b>wrong</b> thing to do. You can read about the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173153.aspx">differences between overriding and the new keyword here</a>.
      </div>

      <li>
        Add the <code class="prettyprint">virtual</code> keyword to the base class <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code> method.
      </li>

      <li>
        Switch over to each of your derived methods and add the <code class="prettyprint">override</code> keyword to indicate this is a virtual method you are overriding. If you miss one, the compiler will remind you with a nice error message!
      </li>

<p><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this,'virtual');return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a>
<div class="indent-none" id="virtual" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
// Operation.cs
public <span class="highlight">virtual</span> string Calculate() {
    return "";
}

...

// AddOperation.cs
public <span class="highlight">override</span> string Calculate() {
    return string.Format("{0} + {1} = {2}",
      FirstNumber, SecondNumber,
      FirstNumber + SecondNumber);
}
</pre></div></p>

    </ol>

    <h2>Treat the classes polymorphically</h2>
    <p>
      Now that the <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code> method is declared on the base class, we can modify our code to work with all our calculation operations through the base class - e.g. treat them as polymorphic.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the <b>Program.cs</b> file and remove the code that is currently creating and working with the operation types.
      </li>

      <li>
        Create a <code class="prettyprint">List&lt;Operation></code> and add each of your operation types to it using the <code class="prettyprint">new</code> keyword.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a <code class="prettyprint">foreach</code> loop to call <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code> on each of the operation types, printing the result of each call into the console.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your code should look something like this:
      </li>

<pre class="prettyprint codeblock">
List&lt;Operation> operations = new List&lt;Operation>();
operations.Add(new AddOperation(10, 20));
operations.Add(new MultiplyOperation(10, 20));
// any other operations you have ..

foreach (Operation op in operations) {
    // Call Operation.Calculate
    Console.WriteLine(op.Calculate());
}
</pre>

      <li>
        Run the application - you should get the exact same output as before, but <em>now</em> the code is going through the base class method - in other words <em>we don't care which object we are working with</em>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Try placing a breakpoint in the <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code> method of one of the operations to see it get called.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Make the base class abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The code works correctly right now, but there's a slight design issue with it currently. It's possible to create a <code class="prettyprint">Operation</code> class directly and use it - but the results are just an empty value since it has not direct behavior on it's own. This is a perfect candidate for an <em>abstract</em> class.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Open <b>Program.cs</b> and add an <code class="prettyprint">Operation</code> object into your list - it should build and run, but you will see a blank line in the output.
      </li>

      <li>
        Open the <b>Operation.cs</b> file and remove the implementation for <code class="prettyprint">Calculate</code>. Change the <code class="prettyprint">virtual</code> keyword to <code class="prettyprint">abstract</code> to indicate it has no implementation.
      </li>

      <li>
        Since we have an abstract method, we also need to make the class itself abstract. Add the <code class="prettyprint">abstract</code> keyword to the class definition.
      </li>

      <li>
        Build the application - you should get a compile error trying to create the <code class="prettyprint">Operation</code> object directly - since it's abstract, it cannot be created on it's own; you can only create a derived version of the operation.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the <code class="prettyprint">Operation</code> from your list and build and run the application to see it all work properly.
      </li>
    </ol>
