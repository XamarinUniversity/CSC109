		<h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
          This is a Xamarin cross-platform class about C#. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin development environment (Mac or Windows) to run the exercise on. Please read the setup requirements if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
        In this course, you will learn  how to use inheritance in object-oriented programmng by applying generalization classes and creating a class that is derived from other. You will also know how to explain polymorphism, create virtual methods and override methods from derived classes.
        </p>

		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ol>
            <li>Use inheritance to eliminate repeated code</li>
            <li>Use virtual methods and polymorphism to write generic code</li>
		</ol>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>
            Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/CSC109/">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/CSC109/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.
        </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<div class="objective">Inheritance: Create a derived class</div>
				<a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
				<br />
                In this exercise, you will take an existing class which performs an <code>Add</code> operation and extract a base class from it to use with other types of mathematical operations. You will then create a few additional derived classes and use them in program.
			</li>

            <li>
                <div class="objective">Polymorphism: Create and override virtual methods</div>
                <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
                <br />
                In this exercise you will create a list of polymorphic classes and iterate over the list calling an overridden virtual method.
            </li>
	   </ol>

    <h2>Homework</h2>
      <p>
         <a href="./parts/homework.html">Homework</a>
         <br />
         This optional homework exercise will help to cement the topics in this class by having you write a C# application to calculate the area for a shape.
